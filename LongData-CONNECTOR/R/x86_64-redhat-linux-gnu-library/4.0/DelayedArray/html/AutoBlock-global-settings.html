<h2>Control the geometry of automatic blocks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A family of utilities to control the automatic block size (or
length) and shape.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
getAutoBlockSize()
setAutoBlockSize(size=1e8)

getAutoBlockLength(type)

getAutoBlockShape()
setAutoBlockShape(shape=c("hypercube",
                          "scale",
                          "first-dim-grows-first",
                          "last-dim-grows-first"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>size</code></td>
<td>

<p>The <em>auto block size</em> (automatic block size) in bytes. Note that,
except when the type of the array data is <code>"character"</code> or
<code>"list"</code>, the size of a block is its length multiplied by the
size of an array element. For example, a block of 500 x 1000 x 500
doubles has a length of 250 million elements and a size of 2 Gb (each
double occupies 8 bytes of memory).
</p>
<p>The <em>auto block size</em> is set to 100 Mb at package startup and can
be reset anytime to this value by calling <code>setAutoBlockSize()</code>
with no argument.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>

<p>A string specifying the type of the array data.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>shape</code></td>
<td>

<p>A string specifying the <em>auto block shape</em> (automatic block shape).
See <code><a href="makeCappedVolumeBox.html">makeCappedVolumeBox</a></code> for a description of the
supported shapes.
</p>
<p>The <em>auto block shape</em> is set to <code>"hypercube"</code> at
package startup and can be reset anytime to this value by calling
<code>setAutoBlockShape()</code> with no argument.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><em>block size</em> != <em>block length</em>
</p>
<p><em>block length</em> = number of array elements in a block
(i.e. <code>prod(dim(block))</code>).
</p>
<p><em>block size</em> = <em>block length</em> * size of the individual elements
in memory.
</p>
<p>For example, for an integer array, <em>block size</em> (in bytes) is
going to be 4 x <em>block length</em>. For a numeric array <code>x</code>
(i.e. <code>type(x) == "double"</code>), it's going to be 8 x <em>block length</em>.
</p>
<p>In its current form, block processing in the <span class="pkg">DelayedArray</span> package
must decide the geometry of the blocks before starting the walk on the
blocks. It does this based on several criteria. Two of them are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The <em>auto block size</em>: maximum size (in bytes) of a block
once loaded in memory.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The <code>type()</code> of the array (e.g. <code>integer</code>, <code>double</code>,
<code>complex</code>, etc...)
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The <em>auto block size</em> setting and <code>type(x)</code> control the maximum
length of the blocks. Other criteria control their shape. So for example
if you set the <em>auto block size</em> to 8GB, this will cap the length of
the blocks to 2e9 if your DelayedArray object <code>x</code> is of type
<code>integer</code>, and to 1e9 if it's of type <code>double</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that this simple relationship between <em>block size</em> and
<em>block length</em> assumes that blocks are loaded in memory as
ordinary (a.k.a. dense) matrices or arrays. With sparse blocks,
all bets are off. But the max block length is always taken to be
the <em>auto block size</em> divided by <code>get_type_size(type())</code>
whether the blocks are going to be loaded as dense or sparse arrays.
If they are going to be loaded as sparse arrays, their memory footprint
is very likely to be smaller than if they were loaded as dense arrays
so this is safe (although probably not optimal).
</p>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that the <em>auto block size</em> setting
is a simple way for the user to put a cap on the memory footprint of
the blocks. Nothing more. In particular it doesn't control the maximum
amount of memory used by the block processing algorithm. Other variables
can impact dramatically memory usage like parallelization (where more than
one block is loaded in memory at any given time), what the algorithm is
doing with the blocks (e.g. something like <code>blockApply(x, identity)</code>
will actually load the entire array data in memory), what delayed
operations are on <code>x</code>, etc... It would be awesome to have a way to
control the maximum amount of memory used by a block processing algorithm
as a whole but we don't know how to do that.
