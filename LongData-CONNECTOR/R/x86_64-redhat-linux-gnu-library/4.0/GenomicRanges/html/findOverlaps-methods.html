<h2>Finding overlapping genomic ranges</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Various methods for finding/counting overlaps between objects containing
genomic ranges. This man page describes the methods that operate on
<a href="GRanges-class.html">GenomicRanges</a> and <a href="GRangesList-class.html">GRangesList</a> objects.
</p>
<p>NOTE: The <code><a href="../../IRanges/html/findOverlaps.html">findOverlaps</a></code> generic function
and methods for <a href="../../IRanges/html/IntegerRanges.html">IntegerRanges</a> and
<a href="../../IRanges/html/IntegerRangesList.html">IntegerRangesList</a> objects are defined and
documented in the <span class="pkg">IRanges</span> package.
The methods for <a href="../../GenomicAlignments/html/GAlignments.html">GAlignments</a>,
<a href="../../GenomicAlignments/html/GAlignmentPairs.html">GAlignmentPairs</a>, and
<a href="../../GenomicAlignments/html/GAlignmentsList.html">GAlignmentsList</a> objects are defined and
documented in the <span class="pkg">GenomicAlignments</span> package.
</p>
<p><a href="GRanges-class.html">GenomicRanges</a> and <a href="GRangesList-class.html">GRangesList</a> objects also support
<code>countOverlaps</code>, <code>overlapsAny</code>, and <code>subsetByOverlaps</code> 
thanks to the default methods defined in the <span class="pkg">IRanges</span> package and
to the <code>findOverlaps</code> and <code>countOverlaps</code> methods defined in
this package and documented below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
## S4 method for signature 'GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges'
findOverlaps(query, subject,
    maxgap=-1L, minoverlap=0L,
    type=c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"),
    select=c("all", "first", "last", "arbitrary"),
    ignore.strand=FALSE)

## S4 method for signature 'GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges'
countOverlaps(query, subject,
    maxgap=-1L, minoverlap=0L,
    type=c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"),
    ignore.strand=FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>query, subject</code></td>
<td>

<p>A <a href="GRanges-class.html">GRanges</a> or <a href="GRangesList-class.html">GRangesList</a> object.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>maxgap, minoverlap, type</code></td>
<td>

<p>See <code>?<a href="../../IRanges/html/findOverlaps.html">findOverlaps</a></code> in the <span class="pkg">IRanges</span> package
for a description of these arguments.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>select</code></td>
<td>

<p>When <code>select</code> is <code>"all"</code> (the default), the results are
returned as a <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Hits-class.html">Hits</a> object.
Otherwise the returned value is an integer vector parallel to <code>query</code>
(i.e. same length) containing the first, last, or arbitrary overlapping
interval in <code>subject</code>, with <code>NA</code> indicating intervals that did
not overlap any intervals in <code>subject</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ignore.strand</code></td>
<td>

<p>When set to <code>TRUE</code>, the strand information is ignored in the
overlap calculations.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the query and the subject are <a href="GRanges-class.html">GRanges</a> or
<a href="GRangesList-class.html">GRangesList</a> objects, <code>findOverlaps</code> uses the triplet
(sequence name, range, strand) to determine which features (see
paragraph below for the definition of feature) from the <code>query</code>
overlap which features in the <code>subject</code>, where a strand value
of <code>"*"</code> is treated as occurring on both the <code>"+"</code> and
<code>"-"</code> strand.
An overlap is recorded when a feature in the <code>query</code> and a feature
in the <code>subject</code> have the same sequence name, have a compatible
pairing of strands (e.g. <code>"+"</code>/<code>"+"</code>, <code>"-"</code>/<code>"-"</code>,
<code>"*"</code>/<code>"+"</code>, <code>"*"</code>/<code>"-"</code>, etc.), and satisfy the
interval overlap requirements.
</p>
<p>In the context of <code>findOverlaps</code>, a feature is a collection of
ranges that are treated as a single entity. For <a href="GRanges-class.html">GRanges</a> objects,
a feature is a single range; while for <a href="GRangesList-class.html">GRangesList</a> objects,
a feature is a list element containing a set of ranges. In the results,
the features are referred to by number, which run from 1 to
<code>length(query)</code>/<code>length(subject)</code>.
</p>
<p>For <code>type="equal"</code> with GRangesList objects, <code>query[[i]]</code>
matches <code>subject[[j]]</code> iff for each range in <code>query[[i]]</code>
there is an identical range in <code>subject[[j]]</code>, and vice versa.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>findOverlaps</code> either a <a href="../../S4Vectors/html/Hits.html">Hits</a> object when
<code>select="all"</code> or an integer vector otherwise. 
</p>
<p>For <code>countOverlaps</code> an integer vector containing the tabulated
query overlap hits.

        ranges=IRanges(1:10, width=10:1, names=head(letters,10)),

        score=1:10,
        GC=seq(1, 0, length=10)
